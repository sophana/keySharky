This fork is a very quick and very dirty port of the excellent keysharky to control spotify web player instead of grooveshark.

For now, only play, previous and next actions are working

This extension has the excellent feature of enabling an http web server to control spotify web player.

This web server only listens to localport, but it is very useful for programming a keyboard key to control spotify from ANYWHERE in your linux desktop (not just only from the firefox window)

Adding more buttons like shuffle, repeat should be very easy.

It should also be quite easy to retrieve some status info.


old documentation of the key sharky is here:
